    <h1>Sausage Gravy</h1>

    <h2>Desscription</h2>
    <p>There are certain recipes that are hallmarks of the South's 
        comfort food. From fried chicken to grits, some recipes 
        are non-negotiable Southern staples. And if you ask us, 
        sausage gravy belongs in that tasty canon. If you haven't 
        had homemade sausage gravy since the last time your
        Grandmother made it. You might be surprised to know it's 
        not as difficult to make as you might think. All it takes
        is three ingredients plus salt and pepper along with some
        whisking to whip up this down-home favorite. The trick to 
        a great country gravy is to brown the sausage in a skillet
        untilit has a deep carmelization on the outside.

    <p>Since this recipe uses such few ingredients, it's important
        to find the best quality of each ingredient that you can.
        We promise you'll taste the difference if you use high 
        quality whole milk from the grocery store or the farmers
        market. What's the best way to serve it? There's the 
        classic settings like biscuits, chicken fried steak, or
        grits, but we also like to serve it with shrimp, rice, and 
        a drizzle of Tabasco hot sauce.
